This directory contains files useful for building Win32 applications.  They are not required for the core svgandme library,
and only exist as a convenience for those who want to build a sample app.

Example apps can be found in the 'testy' directory
svgexplorer - A nice file browsing app that allows you to drag and drop a selection of files
  onto the interface, and click on them one by one in a larger view.

svgviewer - A simple app that allows you to drop one file at a time
